TODO
* tread safety
  - libbde_key_protector functions ?
* add unlock function?
* deprecate use of open return 0 in favor of is locked function?
* add support for passing key directly to library
  - test if keys are valid ?
  - what about issue with key bit size
  - info handle (check if tweak_key is not 0) when diffuser is specified
* update manuals
* metadata
  - compare the metadata values ?
  - check metadata number_of_volume_header_sectors ?
* error tolerance
  - add handling of BDE volumes with corrupt metadata, e.g. file header
* debug print more volume header info
* check debug output alignment
* check TODOs

* pybde
  - add set keys function

Optimizations
* pass values 32-bit to libcaes

Library
* add support for smart card + pin?
* add support for TPM ?

Test suite:
* add options for
  - key data
  - clear key
  - startup key (bek file)
  - partial encrypted volume
* add verify test case
* test images: for Windows Vista, Windows 7, To Go, Windows 8
* python get version
* python read

Tools:
* bdeinfo
  - print more metadata ?
* bdeexport
  - create tool to export decrypted BDE volume to RAW file?
* bdemount
  - implement native MacOS-X version

Format:
* validation
* TPM encoded VMK ?
* VMK date time - change password on USB encrypted drive
* what is entry type 0x000b ?
* why does Windows hide the last 4096 bytes of the volume?
